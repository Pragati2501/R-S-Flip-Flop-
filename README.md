# R-S-Flip-Flop-
* SR flip flop is a gated set reset flip flop . The S and R inputs control the state of flip flop when the clock pulse goes from high to low.
* The SR flip flop will not change until the clock pulse is on the a rising edge (provided it is a positive edge trigerred flip flop). 
* When both S and R are simultaneously high, it is uncertain whether the output will be high or low. This condition is considered as invalid condition.

## Toolchain
* Xilinx for synthesis
* Isim for simulation
